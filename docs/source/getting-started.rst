Getting Started with Eta
========================

In the following sections, we'll cover how to get Eta installed on your system and
how to work with Etlas projects. If at any point you get stuck with any of the steps
below, feel free to join us on `Gitter <https://gitter.im/typelead/eta>`_ so we can
help you troubleshoot.

Installing Eta
----------------

Currently, there are a few ways of installing Eta:

#. Source
#. Docker
#. Nix

Method 1: Source Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

Make sure you have the listed tools/libraries installed on your system. Check the
OS-specific sections for additional requirements.

General
"""""""

- `Stack <https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README>`_
  - Make sure the path that is obtained from running ``stack path --local-bin`` is present on the ``PATH``.
- `JDK 1.7 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html>`_ or `JDK 1.8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`_

  - Make sure ``javac`` and ``java`` are on the PATH.

Ubuntu
""""""

- Install ``bz2``, ``ncurses`` and ``zlib``.

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libbz2-dev

- Make sure locale is set to UTF8.

.. code-block:: console

  export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
  export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

Fedora
""""""

- Install ``bzip2``, ``ncurses`` and ``zlib``.

.. code-block:: console

  sudo dnf install zlib-devel ncurses-devel bzip2-devel

OS X
""""

- Make sure you have `XCode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ installed and
  have accepted the license agreement (run XCode at least once).

Windows
"""""""

- Install ``Cygwin`` and ``MSYS``.

.. note::

  An alternate method of installing Eta on Windows 10 is with WSL (`Windows sub-system for Linux <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about>`_).

  1. Enable WSL within Windows (`Instructions <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/install_guide>`_)
  2. Minimum Windows version: Version 10 build 14986
  3. Enter the root folder of WSL, and create a “.local” folder, and then inside of this create a “bin” folder.
  4. Follow the source installation method.

Installation
""""""""""""

Clone the repository and run the install script at the root of the repository.
Replace ``[current-stable-tag]`` with the tag listed in the README of the eta repo.

  .. code-block:: console

    git clone --recursive --branch [current-stable-tag] https://github.com/typelead/eta
    cd eta
    ./install.sh # or install.cmd in windows command prompt

.. note::

  If you omit the `--recursive` flag to `git clone`, you will need to
  initialize the project's submodules before running `install.sh` or `install.cmd`:

  .. code-block:: console

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Once the installation is done, you will now have access to the following command-line tools:

- ``eta`` - The main compiler
- ``etlas`` - The package manager and build tool

Check to ensure that they are on the ``PATH`` with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   eta --version
   etlas --version

If you obtain an error that either tool is missing, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   stack path --local-bin

Add the path that you obtain in the output to your ``PATH`` environment variable.


Method 2: Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation>`_

Installation
""""""""""""

To obtain an environment with ``eta`` and ``etlas``, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  docker run -it typelead/eta

Method 3: Nix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- `Nix <https://nixos.org/nix/>`_

Installation
""""""""""""

To obtain an environment with ``eta`` and ``etlas``, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  nix-shell -A eta-build-shell

Updating Eta
------------

Eta updates pretty fast and we're incorporating new patches on a daily basis that
you might want to get access to.

If you have Eta already installed, go to the root of this repository's clone on
your system, and run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   ./update.sh # or update.cmd in windows command prompt

This will do a fresh installation, recompiling all the core libraries with the most
recent version of the compiler.

If you have existing Etlas projects, make sure you run

.. code-block:: console

  etlas clean
  etlas install --dependencies-only

inside each project before proceeding with your normal development so that Etlas
recognizes the updated libraries.

Running Your First Program
--------------------------

#. Create a new file called ``Main.hs`` and with the following contents::

    module Main where

    primes = filterPrime [2..]
      where filterPrime (p:xs) =
              p : filterPrime [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]

    main = putStrLn $ "The 101st prime is " ++ show (primes !! 100)

#. Run the following command on the command line to compile the program:

   .. code-block:: console

     eta Main.hs

   This will compile the program to a standalone JAR with the ``Run``- prefix.

#. Run the program with java:

   .. code-block:: console

     java -jar RunMain.jar

.. _setting-up-first-project:

Setting up your first Etlas Project
-----------------------------------

With Etlas, you don't have to worry about remembering all the particular flags to
sent to ``eta``. You can simply specify what you want in a human-readable format
called Cabal. To learn more about the specification file format which is also used
in the Haskell ecosystem, read
`this <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html>`_ guide.

#. Create a new directory called ``eta-first`` and enter it.

   .. code-block:: console

      mkdir eta-first
      cd eta-first

#. Initialize the project with Etlas.

   .. code-block:: console

      etlas init

   This is an interactive command that will ask you questions and help you generate
   a Cabal project file for your project.

   - **Package name** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Package version** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **License** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Author name** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Maintainer email** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Project homepage URL** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Project synopsis** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Project category** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Package build** - Press 2 to select **Executable**.
   - **Main module** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Base language** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Inline documentation** - Press enter to select the default.
   - **Source directory** - Press 2 to select **src**.

   The project structure should look like this:

   .. code-block:: console

      eta-first/
      |--src/
      |----Main.hs
      |--ChangeLog.md
      |--LICENSE
      |--eta-first.cabal
      |--Setup.hs

#. Add the files ``Main.hs`` and ``Primes.hs`` in ``src/`` as shown below.

   Main.hs

   .. code::

     module Main where

     import Primes

     main = putStrLn $ "The 101st prime is " ++ show (primes !! 100)

   Primes.hs

   .. code::

      module Primes where

      primes = filterPrime [2..]
        where filterPrime (p:xs) =
                p : filterPrime [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]

#. Update ``eta-first.cabal``, adding an ``other-modules:`` field:

   .. code-block:: console

      other-modules: Primes

   Any additional modules you add to the project should be added at the same
   indentation level as the ``Primes`` entry, but below it.

#. To build & run, execute this command:

   .. code-block:: console

      etlas run

   .. note::

      Note that this will create a JAR file *without* dependencies. This is
      best suited for development.

      For production deployments, you may want to generate a standalone JAR
      file, also called an **uberjar**. If you would like to generate an uberjar,
      run the following two commands:

      .. code-block:: console

          etlas clean
          etlas configure --enable-uberjar-mode

      These commands need only be run once to set the local Etlas configuration.
      To go back to shared mode for the project:

      .. code-block:: console

          etlas clean
          etlas configure --disable-uberjar-mode

      Beware that this can be very slow. Work is being done to
      `improve uberjar performance <https://github.com/typelead/eta/issues/20>`_.

Learning Eta
------------
Now that you're set up with Eta, the next step is to learn about how to write Eta
programs. If you are already familiar with haskell you can jump straight to the
:ref:`interacting-with-java` section in Eta Tutorials to learn about how to
connect with Java libraries.
